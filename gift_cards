<h2>PROVINCIAL GIFT CARD REGULATIONS</h2>

<p>The province of Alberta passed a gift card regulation that came into effect on November 1, 2008. The complete regulations and FAQ are available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.servicealberta.gov.ab.ca/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" style="color: rgb(0, 136, 204); text-decoration: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background: transparent; cursor: pointer; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgb(255, 94, 153);" target="_blank">www.servicealberta.gov.ab.ca</a>. The relevant Alberta Government FAQS are reproduced below:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Q: Does the regulation apply to gift cards or other kinds of prepaid purchase cards issued by financial institutions?</p>

<p>A: No. If the card is based on a direct agreement between the consumer and the financial institution that issued the card, then Alberta&#39;s gift card regulation does not apply.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Q: Are mall gift cards covered by the new regulations?</p>

<p>A: Yes. Mall gift cards are covered by the regulations unless the cards are issued by a financial institution and the agreement is between the card holder and the financial institution.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Q: What is considered to be a financial institution?</p>

<p>A: A financial institution is a bank, credit union, trust corporation or treasury branch.</p>
