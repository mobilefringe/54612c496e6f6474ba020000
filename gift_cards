<h2>Gift Card Regulations</h2>

<p>The province of Alberta recently passed a new gift card regulation that came into effect on Saturday, November 1, 2008. The complete regulations and FAQ are available at <u><a href="//www.servicealberta.gov.ab.ca">www.servicealberta.gov.ab.ca</a></u><br />
<br />
Based on FAQs posted on the Alberta Government website (<u><a href="//www.servicealberta.gov.ab.ca">www.servicealberta.gov.ab.ca</a></u>), the new rules do not apply where there is a direct card agreement between the consumer and the financial institution (i.e. a bank) that issued the card.<br />
<br />
Accordingly, because our cards are issued by a financial institution and the agreement <strong>is between the card holder and the financial institution, the new rules do not apply to our cards that are issued after November 1, 2008.</strong><br />
<br />
The relevant Alberta Government FAQS are reproduced below:</p>

<p><strong>Does the regulation apply to gift cards or other kinds of prepaid purchase cards issued by financial institutions?</strong></p>

<p>No. If the card is based on a direct agreement between the consumer and the financial institution that issued the card, then Alberta&#39;s gift card regulation does not apply.</p>

<p><strong>Are mall gift cards covered by the new regulations?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. Mall gift cards are covered by the regulations unless the cards are issued by a financial institution and the agreement is between the card holder and the financial institution.</p>

<p><strong>What is considered to be a financial institution?</strong></p>

<p>A financial institution is a bank, credit union, trust corporation or treasury branch.<br />
